    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Stir the yogurt and tandoori masala powder together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; 
                    add the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour. 
                    Drain and discard any excess marinade.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <p>
                    Puree the onion, ginger, and garlic with the water in a blender until it forms a smooth paste; 
                    set aside.
                </p>
            </li>

                        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                    Cook the chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. 
                    Remove from skillet and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons in the skillet. 
                    Fry the onion paste in the hot oil until the moisture is mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.
                    Sprinkle the garam masala and chili powder over the mixture; cook 1 minute more. 
                    Pour the tomato sauce into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 5 minutes. 
                    Return the chicken to the pan along with the half and half; 
                    bring to a boil. Add the butter, fenugreek leaves, and salt; 
                    reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.
